## üéØ Objectives
* Create a "from scratch" **React** app using NPX
* Learn about **React** components and how they are used to dynamically update the DOM with new information
* Learn how **state** and **props** changes are used
* Learn how to use Swagger to interact with the database using a **REST** API 
* Leverage Netlify and DataStax Astra DB

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Frequently asked questions ‚ÑπÔ∏è 

- *Can I run the workshop on my computer?*

> There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine.
> If you do so, you will need
> * git installed on your local system
> * [node 15 and npm 7 or later](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/blog/update-node-js/)
>
> You will have to adapt commands and paths based on your environment and install the dependencies by yourself. **We won't provide support** to keep on track with schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to be successful.

- *What other prerequisites are there?*
> * You will need a github account
> * You will also need an Astra DB account, but we'll work through that in the exercises
> * Use **Chrome** or **Firefox** for the best experience. Other browsers are great, but don't work well with the GitPod integration we use a bit later.

- *Do I need to pay for anything for this workshop?*
> * **No.** All tools and services we provide here are FREE.

- *Will I get a certificate if I attend this workshop?*

> Attending the session is not enough. You need to complete the homework detailed below and you will get a nice badge.

# Let's start
Let's do some initial setup by creating a serverless(!) database.

## 1. Login or Register to AstraDB and create database
**`ASTRADB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 5M writes, 30M reads, 40GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads.  

### ‚úÖ Step 1a: Click the button to login or register with Datastax. You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`.

_Make sure to chose a password with minimum 8 characters, containing upper and lowercase letters, at least one number and special character_

<a href="https://dtsx.io/appdev-7-7"><img src="https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-graphql-netflix/blob/main/img/create_astra_db.png?raw=true" /></a>
- <details><summary>Show me!</summary>
    <img src="https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-stargate/raw/main/images/tutorials/astra-create-db.gif?raw=true" />
</details>

**Use the following values when creating the database**
|Field| Value|
|---|---|
|**database name**| `todos_workshop_db` |
|**keypace**| `todos_keyspace` |
|**Cloud Provider**| *Use the one you like, click a cloud provider logo,  pick an Area in the list and finally pick a region.* |

_You can technically use whatever you want and update the code to reflect the keyspace. This is really to get you on a happy path for the first run._

You will see your new database `pending` in the Dashboard.

![image](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-graphql-netflix/blob/main/tutorial/images/db-pending.png?raw=true)

The status will change to `Active` when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

## 2. Create a security token

‚úÖ  **Step 2a:**  [Create a token for your app](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) to use in the settings screen. Use "Database Administrator" permission.

‚úÖ  **Step 2b:**  Copy the token value (eg `AstraCS:KDfdKeNREyWQvDpDrBqwBsUB:ec80667c....`) in your clipboard and save the CSV, this value would not be provided afterward.

## 3. Create a table with REST API using Swagger

‚úÖ  **Step 3a:** Open **Swagger** by 
1. Click on your active database
2. Click `Connect` TAB
3. Click `REST API`
4. Clik link to your swagger endpoint.

*As show on the picture below.*

‚úÖ  **Step 3b:** In GraphQL Playground, **Populate HTTP HEADER** variable `x-cassandra-token` on the bottom of the page with your token as shown below

![image](img/graphql-playground.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ  **Step 3c:** In GraphQL Playground, create a table with the following mutation, making sure to replace `netflix_keyspace` if you used a different name:

- Copy the following mutation on the left panel
```json
{
  "name": "restfromreadme_by_id",
  "ifNotExists": true,
  "columnDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "id",
      "typeDefinition": "uuid",
      "static": false
    },
    {
      "name": "text",
      "typeDefinition": "text",
      "static": false
    },
    {
      "name": "key",
      "typeDefinition": "text",
      "static": false
    },
        {
          "name": "completed",
          "typeDefinition": "boolean"
        }
  ],
  "primaryKey": {
    "partitionKey": [
      "id"
    ]
  }
}
```
* Use the arrow in the middle of the screen to execute the query

## 4. Insert data in the Table with the REST API using Swagger

‚úÖ  **Step 4a:** In graphQL playground, change tab to now use `graphql`. Edit the end of the URl to change from `system` to the name of your keyspace: `netflix_keyspace`

‚úÖ  **Step 4b:** Populate **HTTP HEADER** variable `x-cassandra-token` on the bottom of the page with your token as shown below (again !! yes this is not the same tab)

![image](img/graphql-playground-2.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ  **Step 4c:** In GraphQL Playground,populate the `reference_list` table with the following values

- Copy the following mutation on the left panel

```json
{"id":"57dbd260-d905-11eb-b985-c522859819b9","completed":false,"text":"TODO FROM README","key":"none"}
```

* Use the arrow in the middle of the screen to execute the query

[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## 5. Retrieving list of values

‚úÖ  **Step 5a:** In GraphQL Playground, not changing tab (yeah) list values from the table with the following query.

```yaml
query getAllGenre {
    reference_list (value: {label:"genre"}) {
      values {
      	value
      }
    }
}
```

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*

## 6. Launch GitPod IDE
- Click the button to launch the GitPod IDE from **YOUR** repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/appdev-week1-todolist/)

## 7. Retrieve application token to securely connect to the database

Use the token you previously generated. If you no longer have the token and did not download a .csv, you can generate a new token using [the instructions above](#2-create-a-security-token)

You will also need the GraphQL Endpoint for your keyspace.
First, go to the Astra DB connect page for your database.
![graphql-endpoint-1](tutorial/images/graphql-keyspace-url-01.png)
Then scroll down to find the endpoint for your keyspace.
![graphql-endpoint-1](tutorial/images/graphql-keyspace-url-02.png)

## 8. Configure Environment Variables and Install Dependencies

‚úÖ Create `.env` file

In the repository directory run the following command  to set up your Astra environment.  Note that this does require Node 15 and NPM 7 to work.  You can install a node version manager like `nvm` or `n` to use multiple versions on your system.
```bash
npm exec astra-setup todos_workshop_db todos_keyspace
```

üë©‚Äçüíª  Install all the packages

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

## 9. Launch your app
  * Run the application 
  ```
  netlify dev
  ```
  * The application should automatically launch in the GitPod preview pane
